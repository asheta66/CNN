Existing optimization algorithms, e.g., Adam, can learn the models fast, but may get stuck in local optima easily.  Adam together with its many optimizer algorithms have been shown to be effective for optimizing a large group of problems. However, for the non-convex objective functions of deep learning models, Adam cannot guarantee to identify the globally optimal solutions, whose iterative updating process may inevitably get stuck in local optima. The performance of Adam is not very robust, which will be greatly degraded for the objective function with non-smooth shape or learning scenarios polluted by noisy data. Furthermore, the distributed computation process of Adam requires heavy synchronization, which may hinder its adoption in large-cluster based distributed computational platforms.\n",

        "* On the other hand, genetic algorithm (GA), a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection in evolutionary algorithms, has also been widely used for learning the solutions of many optimization problems. In GA, a population of candidate solutions will be initialized and evolved towards better ones. Several attempts have also been made to use GA for training deep neural network models instead of the gradient descent based methods. GA has demonstrated its outstanding performance in many learning scenarios, like non-convex objective function containing multiple local optima, objective function with non-smooth shape, as well as a large number of parameters and noisy environments. GA also fits the parallel/distributed computing setting very well, whose learning process can be easily deployed on parallel/distributed computing platforms. Meanwhile, compared with Adam, GA may take more rounds to converge in addressing optimization objective functions.\n",

When the wheel stops rotating, the parent where the arrow points to is chosen for breeding—the greater the probability larger the area on the wheel, leading to a higher probability of being selected.\n",

If the random number generated is 0.28, then the first parent whose cumulative value is greater than 0.28 is P2 hence the winning parent for breeding. \n",

This leads to each individual having an almost equal share of the pie (like in case of fitness proportionate selection) as shown in the following image and hence each individual no matter how fit relative to each other has an approximately same probability of getting selected as a parent. This in turn leads to a loss in the selection pressure towards fitter individuals, making the GA to make poor parent selections in such situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In this, we remove the concept of a fitness value while selecting a parent. However, every individual in the population is ranked according to their fitness. The selection of the parents depends on the rank of each individual and not the fitness. The higher ranked individuals are preferred more than the lower ranked ones.\n",

If each gene has its own space, then the gene_space parameter can be nested like [[0.4, -5], [0.5, -3.2, 8.2, -9], ...] where the first sublist determines the values for the first gene, the second sublist for the second gene, and so on. If the nested list/tuple has a None value, then the gene’s initial value is selected randomly from the range specified by the 2 parameters `init_range_low` and `init_range_high` and its mutation value is selected `randomly` from the range specified by the 2 parameters `random_mutation_min_val` and `random_mutation_max_val`\n",
